## 📅 Special Logic: Schedules & Seasons

The API implements advanced logic to handle parks without official API schedules (e.g., Efteling, Hellendoorn) and seasonal closures.

### 1. `hasOperatingSchedule` Flag
All park objects include a `hasOperatingSchedule` boolean:
- `true`: The park provides official operating hours via an API.
- `false`: The park does not provide official hours. Opening times are either null (future) or reconstructed from activity (past).

### 2. Historical Hour Reconstruction
For past days without official data, the system reconstructs opening hours from ride activity. See the [Smart Gaps Documentation](docs/analytics/smart-gaps.md) for technical details.
- **Opening Time**: First 15min window with >= 10% ride activity, rounded down.
- **Closing Time**: Last 15min window with activity, rounded up.
- **Rounding**: Both times are rounded to the **nearest full hour** for maximum plausibility.

### 3. Seasonal Detection
The system automatically identifies "Seasonal Parks" (parks with winter gaps > 21 days). 
- **Seasonal Parks**: Future dates outside the known operating range are marked as `CLOSED` (suppressing crowd predictions).
- **Year-Round Parks**: Future dates without schedules remain `UNKNOWN`, allowing ML-powered crowd and wait-time predictions for trip planning.
