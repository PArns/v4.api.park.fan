# Calendar, Schedule & ML Rules

Single source of truth for how **status** (OPERATING / CLOSED / UNKNOWN), **crowd level**, and **schedule sync** behave in the API and how the **ML service** aligns with these rules.

## 1. Calendar API Rules (Park has schedule in general)

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/parks/:continent/:country/:city/:parkSlug/calendar?from=&to=`

**Source:** `CalendarService.buildCalendarResponse()` → `buildCalendarDay()` in `src/parks/services/calendar.service.ts`.

### 1.1 Status (ParkStatus)

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| **Future:** OPEN/CLOSED from schedule | `status` comes from `schedule?.scheduleType`: OPERATING → `"OPERATING"`, CLOSED → `"CLOSED"`, UNKNOWN or no entry → `"UNKNOWN"`. |
| **Future:** Days without schedule = UNKNOWN, but with crowd prediction | Future days without schedule keep `status: "UNKNOWN"`. They still get a **crowdLevel** (ML prediction or fallback `"moderate"`), not `"closed"`. |
| **Past + Today:** With crowd level treated as OPEN | Only for **past + today** (`dateStr <= today`): if `status === "UNKNOWN"` and computed crowd level ≠ `"closed"` → `status = "OPERATING"` so we have something to show. Future UNKNOWN are **not** upgraded to OPERATING. |

### 1.2 Crowd Level

- **OPERATING:** `crowdLevel = inferredCrowdLevel` (historical: Redis/Stats/Queue/Analytics; future: ML).
- **UNKNOWN + future:** `crowdLevel = inferredCrowdLevel` (ML prediction or fallback `"moderate"`) – **not** `"closed"`.
- **CLOSED** or past without opening data: `crowdLevel = "closed"`.

### 1.3 Important

- **Crowd level does not influence status** (e.g. no override UNKNOWN → CLOSED just because crowdLevel is "closed"). Status comes from schedule or from the rule “past/today + crowd level = OPEN”.
- **UNKNOWN** = “Opening hours not yet available” (frontend); **CLOSED** = “Closed”.

## 2. Schedule Sync

**Jobs:** `sync-park-schedule` (on-demand), `sync-schedules-only` (daily 15:00), `sync-all-parks` (daily 03:00).

- **ThemeParks API:** 12 months are requested (`getScheduleExtended`). All returned entries (OPERATING, CLOSED, …) are persisted.
- **Normalisation:** In `ParksService.saveScheduleData()`, `entry.type` for **CLOSED** is normalised: `"Closed"` / `"CLOSED"` (case-insensitive) → `ScheduleType.CLOSED`, so off-season (e.g. Phantasialand February) is stored as CLOSED when the API provides it.
- **Gaps:** `fillScheduleGaps(parkId)` creates **UNKNOWN** entries for missing days (up to 90 days ahead) with holiday/bridge metadata. Real CLOSED days only exist when the API returns CLOSED for those dates.

Details: [Schedule Sync & Calendar](schedule-sync-and-calendar.md).

## 3. Next Schedule (Park & Location APIs)

**Used by:** Park integrated response (`/v1/parks/.../integrated`), location/nearby, favorites.

- **Source:** `ParksService.getNextSchedule(parkId)` (and batch `getBatchSchedules`).
- **Behaviour:** Returns the **next OPERATING** day only: query filters by `scheduleType = OPERATING`, `openingTime IS NOT NULL`, `closingTime IS NOT NULL`, from park’s “tomorrow” up to 365 days ahead. **CLOSED** and **UNKNOWN** days are ignored.
- **Result:** `dto.nextSchedule` (openingTime, closingTime, scheduleType) is always an operating day when present; no UNKNOWN/CLOSED in next schedule. TTL and dynamic TTL for closed parks (e.g. expire before next opening) use this next OPERATING entry.

## 4. ML Service Rules & Alignment

### 4.1 Where schedule matters

| Component | File | Behaviour |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Schedule filter (after prediction)** | `ml-service/schedule_filter.py` | Filters predictions by `schedule_entries`. |
| **Inference (features + output)** | `ml-service/predict.py` | Sets `is_park_open`, `status`; overrides output to `crowdLevel = "closed"` for CLOSED/UNKNOWN. |

### 4.2 filter_predictions_by_schedule (schedule_filter.py)

- **Daily predictions:** Only days with an **OPERATING** entry are kept. Days with only CLOSED or UNKNOWN (no OPERATING on that day) are **removed**.
- **Fallback:** If the park has **no** schedule integration (no OPERATING entry in the query), **all** daily predictions are kept (“no schedule” → keep all).
- **Hourly predictions:** Only times **within** operating hours (openingTime–closingTime) are kept; times outside or days without OPERATING with times are filtered out.

**Effect on calendar:** For **future UNKNOWN days** the ML API returns **no** daily prediction (because the day is not OPERATING). The calendar then uses the fallback `mlPrediction?.crowdLevel || "moderate"` for those days – they get a display crowd level (e.g. “moderate”) but not a real ML prediction for that day. To show real ML predictions for UNKNOWN days, the ML filter would need to be extended to optionally return predictions for UNKNOWN days (for parks with schedule).

### 4.3 predict.py (Inference)

- **Schedule features:** From `schedule_entries`, OPERATING/CLOSED/UNKNOWN are evaluated per park/date. A park with no OPERATING entry at all is treated as “no schedule” → predictions are kept.
- **Output override:** If for the predicted time `status === "CLOSED"` or `"UNKNOWN"` (park not OPERATING that day), the response object is set to: `predictedWaitTime = 0`, `confidence = 100`, **`crowdLevel = "closed"`**. The calendar API does not use these values to set status (status comes from schedule/rules), but the ML response is then consistently “closed”.

### 4.4 Summary: ML ↔ Calendar

| Aspect | Calendar (API) | ML Service |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| CLOSED day | `status: "CLOSED"`, `crowdLevel: "closed"` | Daily prediction is not returned (filter_predictions_by_schedule); if one were returned, predict.py would set `crowdLevel: "closed"`. |
| UNKNOWN day (future) | `status: "UNKNOWN"`, `crowdLevel` = ML or fallback “moderate” | Daily prediction is **not** returned (only OPERATING days); calendar uses fallback “moderate”. |
| Past/today without schedule | With crowd level → `status: "OPERATING"` | Independent; calendar derives status from crowd data. |

## 5. Implementation checklist

- [ ] Calendar: Status only from schedule + rule “past/today + crowd level = OPEN”; no status override by crowdLevel.
- [ ] Calendar: Future UNKNOWN days always have a crowdLevel (ML or “moderate”), never blanket “closed”.
- [ ] Schedule sync: API type “Closed”/“CLOSED” is stored as `ScheduleType.CLOSED`.
- [ ] ML: Daily predictions only for OPERATING days (filter_predictions_by_schedule); fallback “no schedule integration” → keep all.
- [ ] ML: CLOSED/UNKNOWN in predict.py → `crowdLevel: "closed"` in response.
